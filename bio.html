	John Savage Wright was born on February 4, 1993 in Virginia. He grew up in the suburbs of Washington D.C. During his childhood, John enjoyed playing with LEGOs and pretending the floor was lava. John received his primary education at The Potomac School in McLean, Virginia, which he attended from enrolling in kindergarten until graduating from high school. During his time at Potomac, he was involved in the varsity sailing and cross country teams and was the president of the debate club. Also, John earned the rank of Eagle Scout during his junior year of high school. For his eagle project, he built a clothing sorting and distribution center in a pediatric center. The purpose of this facility was to provide warmer clothes to the underprivileged children in the winter to prevent them from becoming ill.
