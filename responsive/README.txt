Lab 4 2/3/13
John Wright

I did most of this in class. My sister was in town for the weekend so I didnt finish it off until Sunday. 
The whole lab is only about 5 lines, but it shows a cool concept. I really have nothing to say in this. 
My birthday is tomorrow. 

Implementation was simple. I checked it on my phone and it worked.
