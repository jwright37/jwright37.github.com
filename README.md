Sorry its ugly. I did not have much time to spend a few hours playing with CSS and making everything 
classy and shiny. On the index, I put the links in the text at the bottom, below the title and image.
The css for the index changes simple things such as the fonts and alignment. I was going to change the 
background color, but every color except white looked gross. 

For the biography, the style is reminisint of the index page. Also, the content is not very complicated.

The resume was embedded in the html as a pdf. I already had a pdf of my resume with all the required information,
so I looked for a way to use that and make it able to be downloaded. 

Overall, this project was a good intro to web design and I will probably go back and make it look profesional to
advertise myself to employers.
